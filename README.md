# Design through evolving digital situations; artistic interventions in the clashes as ethical practice collides with capitalist tech structures.

I’m a critical media artist exploring emerging technologies and examining their cultural impacts. Questioning the orthodoxy of tech, encouraging critique of the frameworks through which we experience it. Based between Glasgow and London and building on over a decade of experience across creative industry, I’m involved in creative and professional practice, with outputs across 2D, 3D and interactive media.
